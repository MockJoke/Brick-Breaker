# Brick Breaker (2D)

> Brick Breaker is a clone of the classic arcade game Breakout which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. If all lives are lost, the game is over.
